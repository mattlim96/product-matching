# FuzzyWuzzy Matching

## About The Project

### Context
Given that you are running an e-commerce platform, countering initiatives at a product level against a competitor would involve identifying and mapping the competitor's catalog of products against your own internal catalog before price comparisons are possible. This project aims to optimize the latter part - mapping stage - however automating this mapping process with 100% accuracy is impossible, hence a 2-stage mapping process is required - automated mapping in stage 1 followed by manual mapping in stage 2 to achieve 100% accuracy. Therefore, the primary goal is to decrease the no. of hours for manual mapping by increasing the accuracy and speed of automated mapping as much as possible.

Utilized FuzzyWuzzy matching logic to map products between Shopee and Lazada for countering initiatives.

### Achievement
Optimized the accuracy of existing FuzzyWuzzy matching logic by applying both Token Sort and Token Set methods from FuzzyWuzzy python package, and matched both product name and product description variables.
